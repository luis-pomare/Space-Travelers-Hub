# Space Travelers' Hub

## "Space Travelers' Hub" is a website for who's want to travell to the space. It is a Single Page App (SPA)

***In this group project we lay foundations for Space Travelers' Hub website. We create the React part of the app. We also set up routing using React Router.***

### This project was created using CREATE REACT APP (CRA).

### This group project was made in 4 days, we worked in pair-programming in specific task for each member of this group.

- We used a kanban board to asign the task for each member.

- *We create 3 pages:*

- Rockets: were the user can reserve a rocket or cancel it.

- Missions: were the user can join to a mission or unjoint to it.

- My Profile: were the user can see the rockets and missions wich he applied.

**We add test for components and reducers also.**
